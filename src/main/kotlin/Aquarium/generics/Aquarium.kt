/*
Building generic classes boils down to the following steps:

- Create a type/class hierarchy. The parent is non-specific and the sub-types/subclasses are specializations.
- There is at least one shared property between the classes/types, and it has a different value depending on the subtype (otherwise, having the sub-types is pointless).
- We then have a class that uses all the subtypes, and performs different actions depending on what the values of the subtypeâ€™s properties are.
